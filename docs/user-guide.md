How recommendations, saved workloads, and the Pareto chart work.

## Recommendations

The **Find a model** panel offers two modes using the currently filtered, available, comparable models:

- **Best under budget:** highest score at or below your maximum cost; lower cost breaks score ties. Each billing mode remembers its own budget, initially 1 AI credit or 1 premium request.
- **Cheapest near best:** lowest cost within an allowed score gap from the highest displayed score; higher score breaks cost ties. The default gap is 3 index points, not a percentage.

Exact ties remain recommended together. Star-shaped chart points and **★ Recommended** table labels identify recommendations separately from the Pareto frontier. The panel explains the winning score, cost, and threshold. Over-budget models stay visible for context. Missing data is excluded, and an explicit empty state explains when no model qualifies. Changes to filters, mappings, pricing inputs, or benchmark data recompute the recommendation.

## Saved workload profiles

Save named configurations across projects using the **Saved workload** controls. **Save as** creates and applies a profile from the current settings. Select an existing profile and click **Apply** to restore its task, billing mode, annual plan, token counts, recommendation mode, both budgets, and score gap.

Selecting **Custom** detaches the current workload from a saved profile without deleting it. Changing an applied profile marks it **Modified (not saved)**. **Update** explicitly overwrites that profile with the current workload. **Rename** uses the text in **Profile name**; **Delete** removes the selected profile while retaining the current workload. Names must be 1–60 characters after trimming and unique without regard to case.

Profiles live in VS Code extension global storage and are reusable across workspaces on that installation. They do not contain API keys, model mappings, model selections, or text filters. Applying a profile preserves the current filter. Existing v0.1 settings migrate to a **Custom** workload with recommendation defaults; caches and manual mappings are retained.

## Reading the chart

Higher scores and lower costs are preferred. The dotted line connects the Pareto frontier: models for which no displayed model has both an equal or lower cost and an equal or higher score, with at least one strict improvement. Tied models remain on the frontier. Filtering recomputes the comparison for the visible models. Points with missing data are excluded from the chart, with reasons shown in the table.

Positive costs use a logarithmic axis. If any comparable model has zero cost, the chart switches to a linear axis. The table supports keyboard selection and provides the same values as the chart. Light, dark, and high-contrast themes follow VS Code.

Each preset uses its published Artificial Analysis index directly; scores are not invented or blended into a custom ranking. The tested reasoning variant appears in the details. Benchmark scores are a proxy for task suitability, not a guarantee of performance with Copilot's configuration. Comparing a fixed token workload does not estimate how many tokens different models need to complete the same task.
